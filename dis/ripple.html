            <div class="crypto-container-box-text_paragraph">
                <p id="introduction">is a peer-to-peer protocol created by Ripple Labs in 2012 for the global transfer of funds in a secure, instant and low-cost manner. Conceived to be used by banks and financial institutions, it is defined by Ripple as 'an infrastructure technology for interbank transactions'. The native currency used in the protocol is the XRP toke. Ripple's main partnerships include Accenture, American Express, Deloitte, Santander, UBS and Unicredit.                </p>

                <p id="p1_text">Ripple aims to solve some of the biggest problems facing banks and financial institutions in transferring money globally, especially for cross-border payments. This scenario requires banks to maintain costs in foreign jurisdictions in local currency (Nostro-Vostro process). The Nostro-Vostro process for international fiat currency transactions is long and expensive, taking several days to know if it is successful. This usually creates numerous problems and high costs for those who need to transfer money between different countries, a scenario in stark contrast to a world in which information travels instantly all over the world thanks to the Internet. Ripple has therefore created a network of services, called RippleNet, to interconnect banks and financial institutions and drastically reduce the time and costs required for this type of operation, effectively becoming an alternative solution to the currently used Swift circuit.                </p>

                <p id="p2_text">Ripple uses a public distributed ledger, where all information relating to value shifts is saved. Distributed consensus is achieved using a distributed consensus algorithm called RPCA (Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm). RPCA uses groups of nodes considered reliable by the network (UNL, Unique Node List). At least 80% of the UNL nodes must consider a valid transaction to be inserted into the ledger. This algorithm is very efficient and allows to generate a new state of the ledger every 3-5 seconds, being able to reach about 1,500 tps. The XRP ledger is connected to the real world via Gateways, which allow money and other forms of value to enter and exit the network. The Gateways are also responsible for complying with all local regulations (KYC, AML, CFT) and for reporting any suspected cases to the authorities.                </p>
